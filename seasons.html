		1. dreamweaver made it easier to change text directly in split view instead of in the html file.
		2. Adding an id with the split view prompts a guided process that automatically creates the id selector and media queries in the css file.
		3. About everything can be created and edited right on splitview and it is very responsive with feedback. If the specifics need to defined, right clicking and selecting code navigator or go to code takes me right to the selector to edit the css, no more scrolling or going back and forth between files!
